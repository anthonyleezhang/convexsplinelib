# Convex Spline library

Library for convexity-constrained spline functions, as described in [Larsen and Zhang (2017)](https://anthonyleezhang.github.io/pdfs/envelope.pdf). R code provides functions for constructing spline function lists and matrices, and for approximating function vectors or data given a spline matrix. Matlab code provides basic spline construction function and evaluation functions.
