# Convex Spline library

R Library for convexity-constrained spline functions, as described in [Larsen and Zhang 2017](https://anthonyleezhang.github.io/pdfs/envelope.pdf). Provides functions for constructing spline function lists and matrices, and for approximating function vectors or data given a spline matrix.
